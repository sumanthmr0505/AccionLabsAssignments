Accion Labs Assignments Solutions

Solutions for following exercises:
I built the solutions using Playwrite.
For the Checkers Game, please refer to file - Playwright_Automation > tests > checkerGame.spec.js. Report can be found in Playwright_Automation > playwright-report > index.html
For the Cards Game, please refer to file - Playwright_Automation > tests > blackJackGame.spec.js. I captured the result screenshots when I found the BlakJack and are in Playwright_Automation > zzFoundBlackJack1.png and zzFoundBlackJack2.png

I – The Checkers Game 
===========================
For this exercise, implement the following steps:

 - Navigate to https://www.gamesforthebrain.com/game/checkers/
 - Confirm that the site is up
 - Make five legal moves as orange:
 - Include taking a blue piece
 - Use “Make a move” as confirmation that you can take the next step
 - Restart the game after five moves
 - Confirm that the restarting had been successful

You’ll find that the game engine is predictable enough to allow for you to win a game reliably. So, you can try for this if you’re inclined and have a little time left over.

II – The Card Game
==========================
For this exercise:

 - Navigate to https://deckofcardsapi.com/
 - Confirm the site is up
 - Get a new deck
 - Shuffle it
 - Deal three cards to each of two players
 - Check whether either has blackjack
 - If either has, write out which one does

Keep in mind that, for these exercises, quality wins over quantity. Showcase your coding craftsmanship and standards.

If, for some reason, implementing the steps in code becomes onerous or you don’t have time to complete all seven steps for each exercise, write a quick outline of your strategy and the points where you’d need to think about implementation details. If you’d need help to complete this out during a sprint, let us know what questions you’d ask of whom.

If you have any questions about how to proceed or if any part of these instructions isn’t clear, don’t hesitate to reach out to the recruiter who contacted you. That person will play the role of scrum master in supplying any needed information and removing any obstacle you might encounter. 

Once you’ve gotten as far as you can, please zip the files containing your work into two packages: one for the checkers game and one for the card game. Send them as attachments to an email addressed to the recruiter who contacted you. Feel free to note anything you’d like us to know as we look at your work. Remember that a clear summary of what happened when is a valuable asset throughout the testing process.
